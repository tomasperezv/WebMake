WebMake

- A simple and easy to use static files builder, for web projects:

	- Minimize files and applies the Closure compiler to Javascript.
	- Merge and generate set of files.
	- Threading for processing each file bundle separately, so it can get a
	  better performance while waiting for the network requests(to the Closure API).

- Usage: python webmake.py [path to JSON setup]
	- e.g. webmake.py ./example/project.json

- It uses a simple setup based on JSON, like:
		{
			"optimization": "ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS",
			"bundles": [
				{
					"files": [
						"./js/1.js",
						"./js/2.js",
						"./js/3.js"
					],
					"output": "./js/bundle1.js"
				},
				{
					"files": [
						"./css/1.css",
						"./css/2.css"
					],
					"output": "./css/bundle2.css"
				}
			]
		}

- Generate statistics of the results.
